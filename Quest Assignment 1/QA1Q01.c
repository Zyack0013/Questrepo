// 1. Student Grade Management System
// Problem Statement: Create a program to manage student grades. Use:
// A static variable to keep track of the total number of students processed.
// A const global variable for the maximum number of grades.
// A volatile variable to simulate an external grade update process.
// Use if-else and switch to determine grades based on marks and a for loop to process multiple students.
// Key Concepts Covered: Storage classes (static, volatile), Type qualifiers (const), Decision-making (if-else, switch), Looping (for).
